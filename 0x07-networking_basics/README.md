### Tasks:

**Task 0: [0-OSI_model](0-OSI_model)**

#####  What is the OSI model?

	- [ ] 1.Set of specifications that network hardware manufacturers must respect

	- [ ] 2.The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology

	- [ ] 3.The OSI model is a model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system with a strong regard for their underlying internal structure and technology

#### How is the OSI model organized?

- [ ] 1.Alphabetically

- [ ] 2.From the lowest to the highest level

- [ ] 3.Randomly

**Task 1: [1-types_of_network](1-types_of_network)**

#### What type of network a computer in local is connected to?

- [ ] 1.Internet
- [ ] 2.WAN
- [ ] 3.LAN

#### What type of network could connect an office in one building to another office in a building a few streets away?

- [ ] 1.Internet
- [ ] 2.WAN
- [ ] 3.LAN

#### What network do you use when you browse www.google.com from your smartphone (not connected to the Wifi)?

- [ ] 1.Internet
- [ ] 2.WAN
- [ ] 3.LAN

**Task 2: [2-MAC_and_IP_address](2-MAC_and_IP_address)**

#### What is a MAC address?

- [ ] 1.The name of a network interface
- [ ] 2.The unique identifier of a network interface
- [ ] 3.A network interface

#### What is an IP address?

- [ ] 1.Is to devices connected to a network what postal address is to houses
- [ ] 2.The unique identifier of a network interface
- [ ] 3.Is a number that network devices use to connect to networks

**Task 3: [3-UDP_and_TCP](3-UDP_and_TCP)**

#### Which statement is correct for the TCP box:

- [ ] 1.It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely
- [ ] 2.It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process

#### Which statement is correct for the UDP box:

- [ ] 1.It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely
- [ ] 2.It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process

#### Which statement is correct for the TCP worker:

- [ ] 1.Have you received boxes x, y, z?
- [ ] 2.May I increase the rate at which I am sending you boxes?

**Task 4: [4-TCP_and_UDP_ports](4-TCP_and_UDP_ports)**
```
 - Bash script that displays listening ports.
	Requirements:
		- That only shows listening sockets
		- That shows the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs
```
**Task 5: [5-is_the_host_on_the_network](5-is_the_host_on_the_network)**
```
 - Bash script that pings an IP address passed as an argument.
	Requirements:
		- Accepts a string as an argument
		- Displays Usage: 5-is_the_host_on_the_network {IP_ADDRESS} if no argument passed
		- Ping the IP 5 times
```
